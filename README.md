# Rasterizer

This work implemented a rasterizer along with **UI** and **image filter** to parse 3D scenes. _(Using Qt/C++)_

This program requires `Qt 5.4+` and to run the program:

simply clone/download it
```
git clone https://github.com/Aieener/Rasterizer.git
```
then, open the hw_4.pro file from Qt and press `run`.

Thanks!
